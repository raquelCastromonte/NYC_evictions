#### 1. Meet the Team
Raquel Castromonte, Elizabeth Tum, Andre Cunalata, Alex Reyes

#### 2. Executive Summary
*Situation:*
Our client, BlackRock, wants insights on the housing situation in NYC for long-term investments.

*Complication:*
COVID-19 altered the real estate market in New York City, making investments a high risk action in the early 2020s. As the city is recovering, we are narrowing NYC areas that will increase our clientâ€™s desired investments.

*Resolution:*
We will provide a list of districts that will help support the real estate investments of our clients.

#### 3. Our Client

Our targeted client would like to acquire new property by finding high eviction areas. The zip codes/neighborhoods that are experiencing the most evictions would be on the watchlist of the NYC Department of City Planning for future housing developments.
